Hi, Iâ€™m Lizzie!

:sparkles: I'm a former physicist and current full-stack software engineer.

:sparkles: I love to dabble & learn new technologies, languages, and frameworks. 

:sparkles: I'm interested in getting involved in some OSS, though I'm a lurker for now :eyes:

:sparkles: Some of my favorite side projects lately are public here on my profile! Feel free to check them out.
